Write a Calculator class that contains four basic arithmetic methods: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. The Add, Subtract, and Multiply methods take two decimal values as input and return their corresponding results. The Divide method takes two decimal values as input and returns the result of dividing the first input by the second input.

Then, write unit tests to ensure that all methods of the Calculator class are working correctly. Your tests should cover a range of scenarios, including:

1. Testing for correct addition of two simple decimal numbers.
2. Testing for correct addition of two larger decimal numbers.
3. Testing for correct subtraction of two simple decimal numbers.
4. Testing for correct subtraction of two larger decimal numbers.
5. Testing for correct multiplication of two simple decimal numbers.
6. Testing for correct multiplication of two larger decimal numbers.
7. Testing for correct division of two simple decimal numbers.
8. Testing for correct division of two larger decimal numbers.
9. Testing for correct handling of division by zero.
10. Testing for correct handling of null input values.

Here's a sample code structure to get you started:

```
public class Calculator {
  public decimal Add(decimal a, decimal b) {
    // TODO: Implement addition
  }

  public decimal Subtract(decimal a, decimal b) {
    // TODO: Implement subtraction
  }

  public decimal Multiply(decimal a, decimal b) {
    // TODO: Implement multiplication
  }

  public decimal Divide(decimal a, decimal b) {
    // TODO: Implement division
  }
}

[TestFixture]
public class CalculatorTests {
  [Test]
  public void TestAdd() {
    // TODO: Write test for addition method
  }

  [Test]
  public void TestSubtract() {
    // TODO: Write test for subtraction method
  }

  [Test]
  public void TestMultiply() {
    // TODO: Write test for multiplication method
  }

  [Test]
  public void TestDivide() {
    // TODO: Write test for division method
  }
}
```

Your task is to complete the TODO comments with the appropriate code to implement the Calculator class and its methods, and write the unit tests to verify their correctness. Good luck!
